<h1> <em>My Furry Friend</em> </h1>
    
<h2> Sofie the Shih Tzu </h2>
    
<h3> A Few Things About Her...</h3>
        
<p> Sofie is small, but she is <em> mighty</em>.<br> She likes to sleep all day, which keeps everything tidy.<br> There are days where she doesn't move off of the couch, <br> And we don't bug her because she will then be a grouch.<br><p/>

<p> She will eat anything in sight, especially if it's chicken.<br> Give her a few pieces and you will get so many kisses! <br> She also enjoys ice cream, and if she were a human, it would make her scream! <br><p/>
    
<p> When it's actually time for bed, she will curl right up beside you. <br> It doesn't take much for her to fall asleep- I guarantee you she won't make a peep.<br> Sofie is the best furry friend, one that I can always turn to. <br> She is small, but she will <em>love you!</em></p>      

        
<p><strong><em>The End!</em></strong></p>
